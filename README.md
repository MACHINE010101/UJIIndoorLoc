# DAL Mini Project - UJIIndoorLoc

You are going to choose between this  UCI Machine Learning Repository: UJIIndoorLoc Data Set

And UCI SECOM Dataset | Kaggle

 

You can choose one or both, if you choose both, make one secondary and one primary. 

I appreciate if the data analysis comes with research and formulation of the "why" problem. For that you can choose the paper: (PDF) UJIIndoorLoc: A new multi-building and multi-floor database for WLAN fingerprint-based indoor localization problems (researchgate.net)
